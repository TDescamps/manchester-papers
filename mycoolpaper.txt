Title:
This should've been a catchy title.

Abstract:
Still no idea how people write this..
They generally use a bunch of buzzwords in order to get the attention of the editor. Then use some nice phrasing to make your paper sound more intersting than it actually is.

Conslusion
This is my conclusion
